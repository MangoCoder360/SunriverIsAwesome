<h1>Getting started</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Reuben and this is my blog about Sunriver, OR.
    I live in Southwest Washington and I visit Sunriver every summer.
    Before we get to talking about Sunriver, let me tell you a little about myself,
    as you can guess from the name of this blog, I love Sunriver. I also love coding and thats why this website is not the best,
    I'm coding it myself and not using a website designer such as Wix or Dreamweaver.
    I think this was a good first post, check back later for more! Future content will feature Sunriver :)
